# Project Name

## Overview

This project includes configuration files for IntelliJ IDEA. The `.gitignore` file is configured to exclude specific files and directories that should not be tracked by Git.

## Files

### `.idea/.gitignore`
This file is used to ignore IntelliJ IDEA-specific files and directories, such as:
- `/shelf/`: Stores local changes that are shelved.
- `/workspace.xml`: Contains workspace-specific settings.

## Usage

1. Ensure the `.gitignore` file is placed in the `.idea` directory of your project.
2. These ignored files will not be tracked by Git, keeping your repository clean from IDE-specific configurations.

## Notes

- Modify the `.gitignore` file as needed to include or exclude additional files specific to your development environment.
- This setup is tailored for IntelliJ IDEA users.
